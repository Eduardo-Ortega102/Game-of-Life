## Kata: Conway's Game of Life

This is an if-less implementation of [game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).


## Rules
1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system.
